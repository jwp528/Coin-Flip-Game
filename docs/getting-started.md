## ?? Unlocking New Coins

### How Unlocks Work

Coins unlock based on **achievements** and **random chance**:

#### Achievement-Based Unlocks
Complete milestones like:
- **10 Total Flips** ? Unlocks Gemini
- **25 Heads** ? Unlocks Ram
- **5-Flip Streak** ? Unlocks Rooster
- **100 Total Flips** ? Unlocks Dog

#### Random-Chance Unlocks
Some coins have a small percentage chance to unlock on **any flip**:
- **2% chance** ? River (Common)
- **6% chance** ? Winter (Uncommon)
- **0.5% chance** ? Lisa (Rare)
- **0.1% chance** ? Panda (Very Rare)

**Tip**: Use **Super Flips** (hold the coin) for **3x unlock chances**!

#### Active Coin Unlocks
Special coins require you to **have a specific coin active**:
- **Dragon_Rare**: 0.5% chance when **Dragon** is selected
- **Zen**: 0.5% chance when **Panda** is selected (after 500 flips)

**Pro Tip**: Set **both heads AND tails** to the required coin for **2x unlock chance**!  
**Ultimate Combo**: Super Flip + Both Faces = **6x unlock multiplier**!

Some coins have **special abilities** (indicated by icons):

### ?? Auto-Click

- Great for **passive gameplay**
- Pauses when you manually interact

- Makes the coin **heavier** on this side
- That side **lands DOWN more often** (opposite shows)
- Example: Weighted heads ? Tails wins more

### ?? Shaved
- Makes the coin **lighter** on this side
- That side **lands UP more often**
- Example: Shaved heads ? Heads wins more

### ?? Combo

## ?? Tips for New Players

### 1. Start with Milestones
Focus on **achievement-based unlocks** first:
- Flip until you hit **10, 25, 50, 100 flips**
- Try to get a **5-flip streak** (same side 5 times)
- These unlocks are **guaranteed** with enough flips!

### 2. Use Super Flips for Rare Coins
- **Hold the coin** until it glows (750ms)
- **3x unlock chance** for random-chance coins
- Best strategy for rare coins like **Panda (0.1%)**

### 3. Set Both Faces for Active Unlocks
- Trying to unlock **Dragon_Rare**? Set both heads AND tails to **Dragon**
- **2x unlock chance** when both faces match!
- Combine with Super Flip for **6x total multiplier**!

### 4. Experiment with Effects
- Try the **Digital Ox** for auto-flipping (unlocks at 100 flips)
- Use **DragonCore** (Shaved) to favor one side
- Use **Heavy** (Weighted) to favor the opposite side

### 5. Save Your Progress
- Your progress is **automatically saved** to your browser
- Works **offline** after first load
- **Install as an app** from your browser menu (PWA)
